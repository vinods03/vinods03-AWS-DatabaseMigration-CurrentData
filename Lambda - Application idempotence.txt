Idempotence, in programming and mathematics, is a property of some operations such that no matter how many times you execute them, you achieve the same result.
In the context of REST APIs, no matter how many times you execute a GET statement, you should get the same result.
In the context of lambda / redshift used in this project, idempotence would mean ensuring duplicates are not loaded into redshift even if there are multiple lambda invocations.

Create a Glue crawler on the S3 transformed area - s3://vinod-ecommerce-data-transformed-current/orders/
Provide the Glue Catalog database name where the Glue Catalog table needs to be created.
Attach an IAM role to the Glue Crawler that has access to the required S3 bucket as well as the GlueServiceRole.
Added a prefix "transformed_current_" to the table so that current and historical orders can be identified separately in the transformed area.
We can have both historical and current orders in the same table as well.

Once the Glue Crawler has completed successfully and Glue catalog table is created, query the table in Athena and perform some basic validations like count check.

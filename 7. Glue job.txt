Once data is available in the landing layer, we can create a Spark GLue job and execute / test the job to see if it can transform the data as required.
In the Glue jobs console, i used Create using "Spark script editor" / Create a new script with boilerplate code.
Then i used the same spark script that was used in the historical data process -> EMR cluster -> Step function and made some minor changes like below:
a) Used the SparkSession that is created as part of the boilerplate code
b) copied the code in util.py as well into the main script
c) the environ variables are now passed as "Job Parameters"

Refer Code\Glue\Spark Glue job - landing layer to transformed layer.txt for the code.
